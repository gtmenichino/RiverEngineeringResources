Reestablishing equilibrium between the sediment supply and available transport capacity in the restored reach is the primary objective of the design framework. A geomorphic engineering approach is presented, which recognizes that the river is ultimately the best restorer of its natural morphology and should be allowed to participate in its own recovery. This is accomplished through designing an approximate channel mould, based on the broad dimensions of the river, and then allowing the river itself to develop the intricate cross-sectional detail and intra-reach morphological features to complete the recovery process. Geomorphic engineering provides a practical solution by striking a balance between empirical-statistical and analytical process-based methods.",

This paper describes morphologically similar stream reaches that are divided into 7 major stream type categories that differ in entrenchment, gradient, width\/depth ratio, and sinuosity in various landforms. Within each major category are six additional types delineated by dominate channel materials from bedrock to silt\/clay along a continuum of gradient ranges. Recent stream type data used to further define classification interrelationships were derived from 450 rivers throughout the U.S, Canada, and New Zealand. Data used in the development of this classification involved a great diversity of hydro-physiographic\/geomorphic provinces from small to large rivers and in catchments from headwater streams in the mountains to the coastal plains.",

Many types of practices (dam removal, levee breaching, modified flow control, vegetative methods for streambank erosion control, etc.) are useful, but this paper focuses on channel reconstruction. A tension exists between restoring natural fluvial processes and ensuring stability of the completed project. Sedimentation analyses are a key aspect of design since many projects fail due to erosion or sedimentation. Existing design approaches range from relatively simple ones based on stream classification and regional hydraulic geometry relations to more complex two- and three-dimensional numerical models. Herein an intermediate approach featuring application of hydraulic engineering tools for assessment of watershed geomorphology, channel-forming discharge analysis, and hydraulic analysis in the form of one-dimensional flow and sediment transport computations is described.",

    "Description": "This document provides a systematic hydraulic design methodology to aid hydraulic engineers in the design of stream restoration projects. The objective is to achieve a channel design that fits into the natural system within the physical constraints imposed by other project objectives. In the Corps of Engineers, stream restoration projects are frequently associated with or part of a flood-control project. Thus, projects have more than one objective and compromises may be required to meet essential portions of each objective. The hydraulic design of a stream restoration project should provide for a channel that is in dynamic equilibrium with its sediment load. A sound stream restoration design incorporates techniques from both fluvial geomorphology and physics. The study area to which these techniques are applied must extend beyond the limits of the project site to the extent that both the project's effect on the stream system and the stream system's effect on the project reach can be determined.",

Designers of stabilization or restoration projects must ensure that the materials placed within the channel or on the banks will be stable for the full range of conditions expected during the design life of the project. Unfortunately, techniques to characterize stability thresholds are limited. Theoretical approaches do not exist and empirical data mainly consist of velocity limits, which are of limited value. Empirical data for shear stress or stream power are generally lacking, but the existing body of information is summarized in this technical note.",

The region's history and strongly held values are inseparably intertwined with our streams and rivers. In coastal and inland settings, historic and current settlement and development patterns have centered on streams for transportation, residential, municipal, agricultural, and industrial water supply, power generation, and crop irrigation. Pacific Northwest streams and rivers, and their floodplains provide; food, construction aggregates, and recreational opportunities. Their floodplains provide relatively flat, fertile agricultural land and their forested riparian zones historically supplied timber. However, competing uses of stream corridors in modern society, combined with large-scale alteration of watersheds, have directly and indirectly impacted the abundance, quality, and stability of stream and riparian habitats.",

Sediment transport estimates are calculated on the basis of field measurements of channel geometry, reach-average slope, and bed material grain size. Field data and other relevant input parameters are entered into the program sequentially through a series of prompts to the user. Calculations are carried out using Visual Basic for Applications and the output is stored on individual spreadsheets.",

    "Description": "Large logs are often placed in streams to benefit aquatic and riparian-dependent fish and wildlife as a part of stream restoration projects. When specifying the type of large wood structure to be used, restoration practitioners, planners, and local residents need to be assured that the constructed structures will likely remain in place under the expected conditions. To be considered stable, a structure must be able to resist hydraulic forces with an appropriate factor of safety. The design practitioner is typically forced to perform numerous complex and time-consuming calculations to achieve the desired level of safety, resulting in additional project time and expense. To assist these practitioners, an Excel spreadsheet tool was developed that applies computational equations and design guidelines to analyze virtually any proposed configuration of small-to-medium size structures.",
