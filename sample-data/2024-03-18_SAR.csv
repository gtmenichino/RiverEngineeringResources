The team considered a variety of methods that have been developed to assess stream quality. However, none have received wide spread use or acceptance in 404 because of a failure to satisfy one or more technical or programmatic requirements. One of the most constraining considerations for an assessment procedure to be useful within the 404 program is an ability to assess stream functions accurately and efficiently within the limited time and resources available. EPA’s Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (RBP) (Barbour et al., 1999) was the assessment procedure singled out by the interagency team as having the greatest utility for the program’s needs. This protocol has undergone extensive peer review and is based on sound ecological principles. The procedure also aims to be rapid and, thus, accommodates the time and resource limitations of the 404 program. This document outlines an approach for using the RBP in a manner that assesses overall stream ecosystem integrity and also satisfies the technical and programmatic requirements of the 404 program. "

Data are obtained for each of these metrics at a given site and evaluated in light of what might be expected at an unimpacted or relatively unimpacted site located in a similar geographical region and on a stream of comparable size. A number rating is then assigned to each metric based on whether its evaluation deviates strongly from, deviates somewhat from, or approximates expecta tions. The sum of the twelve ratings, in turn, yields an overall site score. The strength of IBI is its ability to integrate infor mation from individual, population, community, zoogeo graphic, and ecosystem levels into a single ecologically based index of the quality of a water resource.

Reference conditions are best established through systematic monitoring of actual sites that represent the natural range of variation in ""minimally” disturbed water chemistry, habitat, and biological conditions (Gibson et al. 1996).  Of these 3 components of ecological integrity, ambient water chemistry may be the most difficult to characterize because of the complex array of possible constituents (natural and otherwise) that affect it.  The implementation framework is enhanced by the development of an empirical relationship between habitat quality and biological condition that is refined for a given region.  As additional information is obtained from systematic monitoring of potentially impacted and site-specific control sites, the predictive power of the empirical relationship is enhanced.  Once the relationship between habitat and biological potential is understood, water quality impacts can be objectively discriminated from habitat effects, and control and rehabilitation efforts can be focused on the most important source of impairment."

Reference conditions are best established through systematic monitoring of actual sites that represent the natural range of variation in ""minimally” disturbed water chemistry, habitat, and biological conditions (Gibson et al. 1996).  Of these 3 components of ecological integrity, ambient water chemistry may be the most difficult to characterize because of the complex array of possible constituents (natural and otherwise) that affect it.  The implementation framework is enhanced by the development of an empirical relationship between habitat quality and biological condition that is refined for a given region.  As additional information is obtained from systematic monitoring of potentially impacted and site-specific control sites, the predictive power of the empirical relationship is enhanced.  Once the relationship between habitat and biological potential is understood, water quality impacts can be objectively discriminated from habitat effects, and control and rehabilitation efforts can be focused on the most important source of impairment."
