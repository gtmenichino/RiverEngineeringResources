    "Introductory_Description": "This version of the Stream Quantification Tool and Debit Calculator for the Alaskan Interior (AKSQTint) consists of two spreadsheet-based calculators, the SQT workbook and Debit Calculator workbook. These tools have been regionalized for use in single-thread, wadeable streams in non-glacial alluvial and colluvial valleys in the Alaskan Interior (Figure 2). The SQT and Debit Calculator Excel workbooks have been developed to evaluate a suite of metrics that represent structural or compositional attributes of a stream and its underlying processes. Metrics in the AKSQTint represent parameters that are often impacted by authorized projects or affected (e.g., enhanced or restored) by restoration actions. As such, the AKSQTint is not intended as a comprehensive assessment of stream function. The AKSQTint is an application of the Stream Functions Pyramid Framework (SFPF; Harman et al. 2012) and uses functionbased parameters and metrics to assess five functional categories: hydrology, hydraulics, geomorphology, physicochemical, and biology."

    "Introductory_Description": "An interagency team including members from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Kentucky Division of Water (KDOW), and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources (KDFWR) was assembled to address the needs for a headwater stream assessment procedure that would accommodate the 404 programmatic requirements in the eastern Kentucky Coalfield Region. The team considered a variety of methods that have been developed to assess stream quality. However, none have received wide spread use or acceptance in 404 because of a failure to satisfy one or more technical or programmatic requirements. One of the most constraining considerations for an assessment procedure to be useful within the 404 program is an ability to assess stream functions accurately and efficiently within the limited time and resources available. EPA’s Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (RBP) (Barbour et al., 1999) was the assessment procedure singled out by the interagency team as having the greatest utility for the program’s needs. This protocol has undergone extensive peer review and is based on sound ecological principles. The procedure also aims to be rapid and, thus, accommodates the time and resource limitations of the 404 program. This document outlines an approach for using the RBP in a manner that assesses overall stream ecosystem integrity and also satisfies the technical and programmatic requirements of the 404 program. "

The HMFEI is designed for use in the field but does require the taxonomic expertise to distinguish taxa to the Family level in many cases. Although the HMFEI can be a useful rapid assessment tool, it is inferior to a more detailed identification of benthic macroinvertebrates as obtained through analysis of a voucher sample identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level back at the laboratory ("

Also, because the existing multimetric index is based on a population of reference sites with drainage areas mostly greater than 3 mi2, expectations for assemblage metrics are ambiguous for very small headwaters.  Although the narrative ratings are reliable indicators of condition, categorical ratings lack the advantages inherent in a continuously scaled index.  Continuous indexes are more amenable to linear statistics (e.g., correlations against stressors), and provide a finer degree of context for where condition is positioned along a stressor gradient."

It is based on three physical measurements that have been found to correlate well with biological measures of stream quality. Two levels of biological assessment, one at an order-family level of taxonomic identification, the second to genus-species, provide flexibility in reaching a final decision on the appropriate aquatic life use designation needed to protect the native fauna of any primary headwater stream."

Its twelve measures, or metrics, fall into three broad categories: Species Compo sition, Trophic Composition, and Fish Abundance and Con dition (Karr 1981). Data are obtained for each of these metrics at a given site and evaluated in light of what might be expected at an unimpacted or relatively unimpacted site located in a similar geographical region and on a stream of comparable size. A number rating is then assigned to each metric based on whether its evaluation deviates strongly from, deviates somewhat from, or approximates expecta tions. The sum of the twelve ratings, in turn, yields an overall site score. The strength of IBI is its ability to integrate infor mation from individual, population, community, zoogeo graphic, and ecosystem levels into a single ecologically based index of the quality of a water resource.

    "Introductory_Description": "Urban stream restoration typically involves multiple objectives addressing different aspects of ecosystem integrity such as habitat provision, geomorphic condition, watershed connectivity, water quality, and land use change, among others. Multiple stream assessment tools and models have been developed and applied to inform restoration prioritization, planning, and design. Here, we present the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index for Louisville Streams (QHEILS, pronounced “quails”), which is designed as an interdisciplinary assessment method for urban streams in the Louisville, Kentucky metropolitan region. The model adapts a regional habitat assessment procedure called the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index by incorporating additional processes related to geomorphic change and watershed connectivity. The model was developed in the context of the Beargrass Creek Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Study, and QHEILS provides a rapid procedure for assessing multi-objective benefits associated with proposed restoration actions."

As additional information is obtained from systematic monitoring of potentially impacted and site-specific control sites, the predictive power of the empirical relationship is enhanced.

This document does not delineate between parameters that are functions versus those that are structural measures. Rather, the parameters are called function-based because each parameter can be used to help understand the overall function for a given category, which is described below. Stream functions are separated into a hierarchy of categories, ranging from Level 1 to Level 5"

The TN SQT may be used as a mechanism to determine the suitability of a project proposal, its potential to generate credits, project goals, objectives and overall project success over time. This document provides instruction on the use of the TN SQT and Debit Tool for Tennessee streams. These instructions outline the procedures for data entry into the SQT Microsoft Excel Workbooks.

    "Introductory_Description": "This Handbook is a guide to the Phase 1 Watershed Assessment, the first of 3 phases of the Vermont Stream Geomorphic Assessment protocols.  Phase 1 is carried out using existing data such as topographic maps, orthophotos, agencies’ and organizations’ databases, local and resource specialists’ knowledge, and “windshield surveys.”   Windshield surveys provide field data through quick observation without extensive field measurements.    The data collected in a Phase 1 assessment provide an overview of the general physical characteristics of a watershed.  Maps, aerial pictures, and historic information will be invaluable when combined with field interpretations in piecing together the story of a stream’s response to the natural and human disturbances that have occurred over time at the watershed scale.

Tetra Tech, Inc. was sub-contracted to develop a revised Physical Habitat Index intended to update and revise the original provisional index.  The primary goals were to (1) examine the current biological, chemical, land use, and physical habitat data from the 1994-2000 MBSS database to classify streams in the state, develop reference and degraded criteria for each class, investigate habitat metrics that discriminate between reference and degraded condition, and assemble them into a final revised physical habitat index (PHI); (2) relate the revised PHI to biological metrics calculated as part of the MBSS; (3) compare the revised PHI to the original index; and  (4) propose potential new metrics to be added to the current habitat assessment protocol used by the MBSS.

It then points to multiple practices and techniques that may be appropriate for selection by the project team.

The three tools help determine the depth of review required, assure that a project proposal is complete, and guide reviewers through a thorough and scientifically sound project review. The tools are coordinated with the RiverRAT Science Document — the scientific underpinning of the tools — which includes a synthesis of fluvial geomorphology from physical watershed controls to stream processes and channel forms, as well as a synthesis of the project design process from problem identification through project design and post-project appraisal. Utilizing these tools can improve review consistency and transparency, and we believe that there can be a feedback with project development to improve project designs, and most importantly, place problems and solutions in context with physical process drivers and geomorphic controls on aquatic habitat creation and maintenance.
